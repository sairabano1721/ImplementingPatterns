# ImplementingPatterns

*In this project, we will practice the implementation of design patterns*

You need to design and implement:

1. Bridge Pattern
2. Observer Pattern
3. Visitor Pattern

You can implement all patterns in the same implementation or separately. Implementing these patterns in your Facility Management System is a big plus.

**Supporting documents**:

1. Class notes and examples as well as links for patterns
2. Design Patterns book by Gamma or Head First Patterns book
3. Search on the web to get more information on the patterns

***Project Expectation***:

1. Group executed project
2. Submission of Design and Code

****Project Submission and Grading****:

1. 15% of total grade
2. Email or Submit on Sakai
3. Complete documentation on what problem you solved with the patterns
4. Your code OR the location of your solution for the implementation

*****Project Due Date*****:
Submission of the Implementation: EOD 04/26/2021
